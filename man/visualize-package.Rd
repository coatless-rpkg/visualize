\title{visualize: Graph Probability Distributions with User Supplied Parameters and Statistics}
\description{
Graphs the pdf or pmf and highlights what area or probability is
    present in user defined locations. Visualize is able to provide lower tail,
    bounded, upper tail, and two tail calculations. Supports strict and equal
    to inequalities.  Also provided on the graph is the mean and variance of
    the distribution.
}
\examples{

## visualize.it acts as the general wrapper.
## For guided application of visualize, see the visualize.distr_name list.
# Binomial distribution evaluated at lower tail.
visualize.it(dist = 'binom', stat = 2, params = list(size = 4,prob = .5),
             section ="lower", strict = TRUE)
visualize.binom(stat = 2, size = 4, prob =.5, section ="lower", strict = TRUE)

# Set to shade inbetween a bounded region.
visualize.it(dist = 'norm', stat = c(-1, 1), list(mu = 0, sd = 1), section="bounded")
visualize.norm(stat = c(-1, 1), mu = 0, sd = 1, section ="bounded")

# Gamma distribution evaluated at upper tail.
visualize.it(dist = 'gamma', stat = 2, params = list(alpha = 2, theta = 1), section="upper")
visualize.gamma(stat = 2, alpha = 2, theta = 1, section="upper")
